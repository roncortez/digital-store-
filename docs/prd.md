# Digital Store Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable users to buy and sell used products through a digital marketplace
- Implement a loyalty rewards program where users earn points from purchases and drop-offs
- Allow points redemption for exclusive benefits from partner companies
- Foster sustainable consumption by promoting reuse of pre-owned items
- Build customer loyalty through gamified engagement and community-driven features

### Background Context
The digital store addresses the growing need for convenient platforms to monetize used products while rewarding customer loyalty. Current e-commerce solutions lack integrated support for secondary markets, leading to missed revenue opportunities and inefficient processes for used goods. This platform creates a sustainable ecosystem where users can easily list, sell, and purchase pre-owned items, earning rewards that enhance their shopping experience and support partner benefits. By combining commerce with social impact through donation features, it appeals to eco-conscious consumers seeking value and positive impact.
